            <h3>ðŸŒŸ My Personal Journey ðŸŒŸ</h3>
            <p class="content">
                There was a time when I didn't think I was good at math, but today I have an extensive knowledge of machine learning and neural networks. As a child, I felt that quantitative sciences were not for me, thinking they were reserved for the "smart kids." When it came time to go to college, I decided to hold off until I felt ready to make an informed decision about what field I wanted to study.
                <br><br>
                I worked in retail for a few years and discovered that I actually had a strong aptitude for math. I could handle cash quickly and accurately, providing customers with their change in seconds. Managing large sums of money was incredibly satisfying, even though the funds belonged to the business owners, not me. This realization inspired me to go back to school to study math.
                <br><br>
                My first college class was arithmetic, where I relearned the basics of addition and subtraction on the first day. I was hooked, and I wanted to push beyond the invisible ceiling that had always seemed to hold me back. Learning how numbers work together in a college setting was a completely different experience. For the first time, I no longer felt inadequate at mathâ€”I knew I was good at it.
                <br><br>
                I continued at community college, taking non-transferable math classes. I understood these courses wouldnâ€™t count toward a degree, but I was driven by a desire to learn. I took every math class I could and became obsessed with the subject. I quickly advanced from arithmetic to multivariate calculus.
                <br><br>
                Along the way, I took a logic class and learned about proofs, which opened up a new way of thinking. My background in logic and math gave me an intuitive understanding of programming concepts, making learning to code an exciting and natural progression.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, I transferred to a four-year university and majored in statistics. During this time, I served as a tutor for statistics students, helping others who held the same belief that I once did: that they weren't good at math.
                <br><br>
                My foundation in statistics and passion for programming led me to the field of machine learning and data science. I joined the Data Science Club at California State University, East Bay, where I served as vice president and later became president during my senior year. While I was in the club, I discovered a love for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and realized that textual data was my true calling, leading me to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs). I also discovered that I had a knack for explaining complex concepts in a way that was easy to understand.
                <br><br>
                When it came time to apply to master's programs, I used the culmination of my experiences to guide my decision. I was dead set on one school: the University of San Francisco. I was accepted into the school's Master of Science in Data Science program, which had just a 17% acceptance rate that year. The program was rigorous and challenging, and I completed it while working as a contracted data scientist at Pacific Gas and Electric Company. I was able to apply my skills in a professional setting, where I trained a neural language model using text from the company's internal knowledge base.
                <br><br>
                Today, I am looking to transition into a full-time data science role. I am excited to continue learning and growing in the field, and I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way. I am proud of the skills I have developed and the knowledge I have gained, and I am eager to see where my career takes me next.
