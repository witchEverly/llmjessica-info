            <h3>ðŸŒŸ My Personal Journey ðŸŒŸ</h3>
            <p class="content">
                There was a time when I thought math wasn't for me, but today I have extensive knowledge of machine learning and neural networks. As a child, I believed quantitative sciences were only for "smart kids." After high school, I worked in retail, where I discovered I had a knack for mathâ€”handling cash quickly and accurately was deeply satisfying. Inspired, I returned to school to study math.
                <br><br>
                Starting with basic arithmetic, I fell in love with numbers and pushed past the limits I once felt. I progressed rapidly, from arithmetic to multivariable calculus, driven by a pure desire to learn. A logic class introduced me to proofs, sparking a new way of thinking and naturally leading me to programming, where math and logic seamlessly came together.
                <br><br>
                I eventually transferred to a four-year university and majored in statistics. During this time, I worked as a tutor and teaching assistant, helping others overcome the same belief I once heldâ€”that math wasn't for them. My foundation in statistics and passion for programming opened the door to machine learning and data science. I joined the Data Science Club at California State University, East Bay, where I served as vice president and later president. It was during this time I discovered my love for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the potential of textual data, guiding me toward the world of Large Language Models (LLMs).
                <br><br>
                When it came time to apply for graduate school, I knew exactly where I wanted to go: the University of San Francisco. I was accepted into their Master of Science in Data Science program, with a competitive 17% acceptance rate that year. The program was rigorous, but I thrived, balancing my studies with a role as a contracted data scientist at Pacific Gas and Electric Company. There, I applied my skills to train a neural language model using the companyâ€™s internal knowledge base.
                <br><br>
                Now, I am eager to transition into a full-time data science role. Iâ€™m excited to continue growing, leveraging my experience in NLP, machine learning, and statistics to solve real-world problems. From struggling with math as a child to where I am today, Iâ€™m proud of the journey that brought me here and excited for what comes next.
